([Insert Build Pictures here]
if you donâ€™t have build pictures, try to describe the build so we can envision it)
so i built a house and it's pretty decently sized, and I put a crafting table and furnace inside of it, there were two crafting tables because i wanted them to be centred and four furnaces (two on each side of the crafting table) on top of those were two brewing stands on the crafting table and two anvils on the brewing stands, on the furnaces there were two double chests (one on each side) that i would store items in, then on top of them were more double chests making it one block before the ceiling,and on top of the anvils this happened too. I forgot to mention that the house was made of oak planks with oak logs as a frame and oak doors, there were glass panes as windows on the sides of the build to allow natural light into the building, there were also torches in the house so that it is safe during the night. A trapdoor in the corner of the house leads down a ladder and into my mine, where i mine diamonds. Back in the house there is a staircase above the trapdoor leading to the top floor,  where my bed is, only half of the bottom floor is covered by the top and the edges stop you from falling off due to fences, the whole floor of the house is made out of wood and the top floor's floor has orange carpet to compliment the orange bed which lays one block away from the wall with fancy wooden stairs and slabs making a pattern around it, more chests are next to the bed, as you look down while sleeping there is a sign that says "toycat is yes" and "sub to pewds" on line 1 and line 3 respectively.
